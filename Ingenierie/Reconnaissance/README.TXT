Hi, this is the method for face recognition, its name is openface which I cloned from github.
I'm installing this method by using Docker.(btw: highly recommends this software)
And I have trained the classfier with those stars whoes names started with A.
Totally, here gets three steps to execute the process.
Firstly, aligned-face, that's to say face-detection.
Secondly, class the faces in right order.
Finally, train the classifier with the pre-faces.
And we get a classifier.pkj at the end which realizes the fonction of recongnition.
